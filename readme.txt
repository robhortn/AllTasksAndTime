All Tasks And Time (ATAT) is a time logging program.
Think of it like a timecard punch clock on your desktop.  
You choose a task, punch in and the timer runs, recording your time for it.
Change tasks and punch in again and ATAT stops tracking time for the 
previous task and starts tracking it for the new one.

Time never stops.
You're always doing something.
ATAT matches what you do with where time went.
